   - Provide local transcription capabilities
   - Integrate with Groq API for cloud-based transcription
   - Support multiple languages through the Whisper models

2. **Audio Management**
   - Allow users to upload local audio files
   - Support extracting audio from YouTube videos
   - Provide audio playback capabilities

3. **Transcription Display and Export**
   - Multiple display modes: compact, segments, segments with timestamps
   - Allow editing of transcription text
   - Support copying to clipboard and downloading as text files
   - Name downloaded files based on source audio

4. **Summarization**
   - Generate summaries of transcribed content
   - Allow editing of summaries
   - Support for different types of content (conversations, lectures, etc.)

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Fast local transcription for smaller models
   - Efficient processing of audio files
   - Responsive UI even during long-running transcription jobs

2. **Usability**
   - Intuitive interface for uploading and transcribing audio
   - Clear feedback on processing status
   - Mobile-responsive design
