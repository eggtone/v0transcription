# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus of the V0 Audio Transcription App is on improving the batch processing experience with enhanced progress tracking and UI enhancements that provide clearer feedback during the transcription process.

## Recent Changes

### Batch Processing UI Improvements (2025-03-23)
- Modified reprocessing buttons to always be visible but disabled during processing
- Added detailed file splitting progress indicators showing completion percentage and elapsed time
- Added per-part transcription timing display for multi-part file processing
- Improved progress visualization with color-coded statuses for different processing phases
- Enhanced audio-utils with progress callback support for file splitting operations

### Fix Timestamps in Transcription (2025-03-16)
- Changed Whisper output format from TXT to JSON to get accurate timestamps
- Updated code to parse JSON output and extract segments with correct timestamps
- Added fallback to creating segments from text if JSON parsing fails
- Fixed timestamp estimation algorithm to be more accurate when fallback is used

### Improve File Naming for Downloads (2025-03-16)
- Modified download functionality to use original audio filename as base
- Added "_transcription.txt" suffix for transcription downloads
- Added "_summary.txt" suffix for summary downloads
- Updated both TranscriptionDisplay and TranscriptionSummarization components

### Documentation Updates (2025-03-16)
- Updated README to clarify that segments come directly from the transcription model
- Improved descriptions of display modes to be more accurate
- Removed references to splitting audio in documentation

## In-Progress Work

### Batch Processing Enhancements
- Implementing more detailed progress indicators for multi-stage processes
- Adding timing information for all processing steps
- Improving UI consistency across different processing states
- Enhancing visibility of buttons and controls during processing

### Whisper Integration Improvements
- Continuing to refine the local Whisper integration
- Investigating Apple Silicon GPU support reliability
- Optimizing processing performance for larger files

### YouTube Integration
- Working on more robust YouTube URL parsing
- Improving error handling for YouTube extraction failures
- Considering caching mechanisms for frequently accessed videos

## Pending Decisions

### Progress Tracking Approach
- Evaluating granularity of progress indicators (too much information vs. not enough)
- Considering animated progress indicators for better visual feedback
- Deciding on placement and styling of time-related information

### Transcription Model Selection
- Evaluating additional Whisper model options
- Considering other transcription APIs besides Groq
- Deciding on optimal default model for different use cases

### User Interface
- Considering redesign of the model selection interface
- Evaluating additional display modes for transcriptions
- Deciding on mobile optimization strategies

## Known Issues

### Processing Limitations
- Long audio files (>30 minutes) may hit timeout limits
- GPU processing on Apple Silicon can be unstable
- Some YouTube videos may be inaccessible due to restrictions

### Browser Compatibility
- Some older browsers may have audio playback issues
- Mobile browsers may have limitations with file uploads
- Safari has some quirks with audio visualization

## Next Steps

1. **Further Batch Processing Improvements**
   - Add more file information during processing (file type, size, estimated completion time)
   - Implement cancellation for individual files during batch processing
   - Add batch processing statistics (average time per file, success/failure rates)

2. **GPU Acceleration Improvements**
   - Enhance stability of GPU-accelerated transcription
   - Add better error handling for GPU failures
   - Implement adaptive timeout based on file size

3. **Usability Enhancements**
   - Improve the visual distinction between different processing states
   - Implement progress indication for model downloads
   - Add ability to save and restore transcription sessions

4. **Integration Opportunities**
   - Explore integration with other AI models for summarization
   - Consider adding translation capabilities
   - Investigate speech-to-text for real-time transcription
