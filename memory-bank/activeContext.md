# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus of the V0 Audio Transcription App is on improving the accuracy and usability of the transcription functionality, particularly around timestamp handling and user experience enhancements.

## Recent Changes

### Fix Timestamps in Transcription (2025-03-16)
- Changed Whisper output format from TXT to JSON to get accurate timestamps
- Updated code to parse JSON output and extract segments with correct timestamps
- Added fallback to creating segments from text if JSON parsing fails
- Fixed timestamp estimation algorithm to be more accurate when fallback is used

### Improve File Naming for Downloads (2025-03-16)
- Modified download functionality to use original audio filename as base
- Added "_transcription.txt" suffix for transcription downloads
- Added "_summary.txt" suffix for summary downloads
- Updated both TranscriptionDisplay and TranscriptionSummarization components

### Documentation Updates (2025-03-16)
- Updated README to clarify that segments come directly from the transcription model
- Improved descriptions of display modes to be more accurate
- Removed references to splitting audio in documentation

## In-Progress Work

### Whisper Integration Improvements
- Continuing to refine the local Whisper integration
- Investigating Apple Silicon GPU support reliability
- Optimizing processing performance for larger files

### YouTube Integration
- Working on more robust YouTube URL parsing
- Improving error handling for YouTube extraction failures
- Considering caching mechanisms for frequently accessed videos

## Pending Decisions

### Transcription Model Selection
- Evaluating additional Whisper model options
- Considering other transcription APIs besides Groq
- Deciding on optimal default model for different use cases

### User Interface
- Considering redesign of the model selection interface
- Evaluating additional display modes for transcriptions
- Deciding on mobile optimization strategies

## Known Issues

### Processing Limitations
- Long audio files (>30 minutes) may hit timeout limits
- GPU processing on Apple Silicon can be unstable
- Some YouTube videos may be inaccessible due to restrictions

### Browser Compatibility
- Some older browsers may have audio playback issues
- Mobile browsers may have limitations with file uploads
- Safari has some quirks with audio visualization

## Next Steps

1. **GPU Acceleration Improvements**
   - Enhance stability of GPU-accelerated transcription
   - Add better error handling for GPU failures
   - Implement adaptive timeout based on file size

2. **Usability Enhancements**
   - Add bulk file processing capabilities
   - Implement progress indication for model downloads
   - Add ability to save and restore transcription sessions

3. **Integration Opportunities**
   - Explore integration with other AI models for summarization
   - Consider adding translation capabilities
   - Investigate speech-to-text for real-time transcription
